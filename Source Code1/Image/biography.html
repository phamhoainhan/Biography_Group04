                    <p class="card-text">Maria Skłodowska was born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in
                      the Russian Empire, on 7 November 1867, the fifth and youngest child of
                      well-known teachers Bronisława, née Boguska, and Władysław Skłodowski.
                      The elder siblings of Maria (nicknamed Mania) were Zofia (born 1862,
                      nicknamed Zosia), Józef (born 1863, nicknamed Józio), Bronisława (born
                      1865, nicknamed Bronia) and Helena (born 1866, nicknamed Hela).

                      On both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost their property
                      and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings
                      aimed at restoring Poland's independence (the most recent had been the
                      January Uprising of 1863-65). This condemned the subsequent generation,
                      including Maria and her elder siblings, to a difficult struggle to get ahead
                      in life. Maria's paternal grandfather, Józef Skłodowski , had been
                      principal of the Lublin primary school attended by Bolesław Prus, who
                      became a leading figure in Polish literature.

                      Władysław Skłodowski taught mathematics and physics, subjects that Maria was
                      to pursue, and was also director of two Warsaw gymnasia (secondary schools)
                      for boys. After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from
                      the Polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home and
                      instructed his children in its use. He was eventually fired by his
                      Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments and forced to take
                      lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment and
                      eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the
                      house. Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding
                      school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born.
                      She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old. Less
                      than three years earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus
                      contracted from a boarder.Maria's father was an atheist,


                      Maria (left) and sister Bronisława, c.1886
                      When she was ten years old, Maria began attending the boarding school of J.
                      Sikorska; next, she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she graduated
                      on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal. After a collapse, possibly due to
                      depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with
                      relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in Warsaw, where
                      she did some tutoring. Unable to enroll in a regular institution of
                      higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisława
                      became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated
                      as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning
                      that admitted women students.At the beginning of 1890, Bronisława—who a few
                      months earlier had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social
                      and political activist—invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined
                      because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her a
                      year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds. She was helped by
                      her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again. All
                      that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging
                      letters, and being tutored herself. In early 1889 she returned home to
                      her father in Warsaw. She continued working as a governess and remained
                      there until late 1891. She tutored, studied at the Flying University,
                      and began her practical scientific training (1890-91) in a chemical
                      laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie
                      Przedmieście 66, near Warsaw's Old Town.The laboratory was run
                      by her cousin Józef Boguski, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg
                      to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">In late 1891, she left Poland for France. In Paris,
                      Maria (or Marie, as she would be known in France) briefly found shelter with
                      her sister and brother-in-law before renting a garret closer to the
                      university, in the Latin Quarter, and proceeding with her studies of
                      physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the University of Paris, where she
                      enrolled in late 1891. She subsisted on her meagre resources,
                      keeping herself warm during cold winters by wearing all the clothes she had.
                      She focused so hard on her studies that she sometimes forgot to eat.
                      Skłodowska studied during the day and tutored evenings, barely earning her
                      keep. In 1893, she was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an
                      industrial laboratory of Gabriel Lippmann. Meanwhile, she continued studying
                      at the University of Paris and with the aid of a fellowship she was able to
                      earn a second degree in 1894.

                      Skłodowska had begun her scientific career in Paris with an investigation of
                      the magnetic properties of various steels, commissioned by the Society for
                      the Encouragement of National Industry. That same year, Pierre Curie
                      entered her life: it was their mutual interest in natural sciences that drew
                      them together. Pierre Curie was an instructor at The City of Paris
                      Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution (ESPCI
                      Paris). They were introduced by Polish physicist Józef Wierusz-Kowalski,
                      who had learned that she was looking for a larger laboratory space,
                      something that Wierusz-Kowalski thought Pierre could access. Though
                      Curie did not have a large laboratory, he was able to find some space for
                      Skłodowska where she was able to begin work..Their mutual passion for
                      science brought them increasingly closer, and they began to develop feelings
                      for one another. Eventually, Pierre proposed marriage, but at first
                      Skłodowska did not accept as she was still planning to go back to her native
                      country. Curie, however, declared that he was ready to move with her to
                      Poland, even if it meant being reduced to teaching French. Meanwhile,
                      for the 1894 summer break, Skłodowska returned to Warsaw, where she visited
                      her family. She was still labouring under the illusion that she would be
                      able to work in her chosen field in Poland, but she was denied a place at
                      Kraków University because of sexism in academia. A letter from Pierre
                      convinced her to return to Paris to pursue a Ph.D. At Skłodowska's
                      insistence, Curie had written up his research on magnetism and received his
                      own doctorate in March 1895; he was also promoted to professor at the
                      School. A contemporary quip would call Skłodowska "Pierre's biggest
                      discovery".

                      On 26 July 1895, they were married in Sceaux; neither wanted a religious
                      service. Curie's dark blue outfit, worn instead of a bridal gown,
                      would serve her for many years as a laboratory outfit. They shared two
                      pastimes: long bicycle trips and journeys abroad, which brought them even
                      closer. In Pierre, Marie had found a new love, a partner, and a scientific
                      collaborator on whom she could depend.</p>

                    <p class="card-text"> Marie Curie (Warsaw, 1867 – Sallanches, France, 1934) and
                      Pierre Curie (Paris, 1859 – Paris, 1906)

                      Marriage of French chemists. She, Polish by birth, Marie Sklodowska, was
                      trained in her native country and in 1891 she went to Paris to further her
                      studies at the Sorbonne. She graduated from the university in 1893, and
                      received her doctorate ten years later. Shortly after her arrival in France,
                      she met the French physicist Pierre Curie, whom she married in 1895. The
                      fruit of this union would be her two daughters, Ève and Irène.

                      Marie was initially a professor at the Normal School for Women in Sèvres
                      (1900), and then Pierre Curie's assistant in his laboratory from 1904. Upon
                      succeeding her husband, on his death, in his position as professor at the
                      University of The Sorbonne became the first woman to occupy a position of
                      these characteristics in France.

                      Pierre Curie, a graduate from the Sorbonne and a doctorate in 1895 from the
                      same university, had been appointed professor at this institution in 1900.
                      Before beginning his collaboration with Marie, he worked in the field of
                      crystallography in collaboration with his brother, discovering
                      piezoelectricity (1880).

                      In 1895 he verified that ferromagnetic bodies become paramagnetic from a
                      certain temperature known today as the "Curie point". He determined the
                      relationship between paramagnetism and temperature (Curie's law) and
                      established the difference between paramagnetism and diamagnetism. He is
                      also responsible for the invention of a torsion balance, known as the
                      Curie-Chèneveau balance, which allows high-precision weighing.

                      In 1896 he began collaborating with his wife in the study of radioactivity,
                      discovered by the French physicist H. Becquerel, work that would lead to the
                      discovery of the existence of two new elements in 1898: polonium, a name
                      given to it gave in remembrance of Marie's homeland, and the radio. The
                      difficulty of these studies is evident if one takes into account that to
                      obtain a single gram of pure radium chloride, the couple had to treat eight
                      tons of the mineral known as pitchblende.

                      From then on, Marie concentrated on obtaining metallic radium, which she
                      achieved in collaboration with A. Debierne, while Pierre studied the
                      chemical, physiological and luminous properties of radioactive emissions,
                      which he classified, according to their charge, as positive (alpha rays),
                      neutral (gamma rays) and negative (beta rays).After Pierre's death, Marie
                      continued the work and founded the Radium Institute (1914), in which she
                      carried out an in-depth study of the applications of X-rays and
                      radioactivity in fields such as medicine, and achieved obtaining numerous
                      radioactive substances with various applications. Among the samples of this
                      collection, the one that, in 1921, she gave to the president of the United
                      States, Harding, stands out, which had been financed with voluntary
                      contributions from innumerable women of the American country.

                    <p class="card-text">During World War I, Curie recognised that wounded soldiers
                      were best served if operated upon as soon as possible.[58] She saw a need
                      for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield
                      surgeons,[57] including to obviate amputations when in fact limbs could be
                      saved.[59][60] After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive
                      mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and
                      developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as
                      petites Curies ("Little Curies"). She became the director of the Red
                      Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre,
                      operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military doctor and her
                      17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile
                      radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals
                      in the first year of the war. Later, she began training other women
                      as aides.

                      In 1915, Curie produced hollow needles containing "radium emanation", a
                      colourless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon,
                      to be used for sterilizing infected tissue. She provided the radium from her
                      own one-gram supply. It is estimated that over a million wounded
                      soldiers were treated with her X-ray units.Busy with this work, she
                      carried out very little scientific research during that period. In spite
                      of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, Curie never
                      received any formal recognition of it from the French government.

                      Also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel
                      Prize medals to the war effort but the French National Bank refused to
                      accept them. She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money. She
                      said:
                      I am going to give up the little gold I possess. I shall add to this the
                      scientific medals, which are quite useless to me. There is something else:
                      by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to
                      remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we
                      possess. I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The
                      state needs it. Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be
                      lost.

                      She was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France dedicated
                      to the Polish cause. After the war, she summarized her wartime
                      experiences in a book, Radiology in War (1919).</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Curie visited Poland for the last time in early
                      1934. A few months later, on 4 July 1934, she died aged 66 at the
                      Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed
                      to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation, causing
                      damage to her bone marrow.

                      The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her
                      work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later
                      developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in
                      her pocket,and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the
                      faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also
                      exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist
                      in field hospitals during the war. In fact, when Curie's body was
                      exhumed in 1995, the French Office de Protection contre les Rayonnements
                      Ionisants (ORPI) "concluded that she could not have been exposed to lethal
                      levels of radium while she was alive". They pointed out that radium poses a
                      risk only if it is ingested, and speculated that her illness was more
                      likely to have been due to her use of radiography during the First World
                      War.

                      She was interred at the cemetery in Sceaux, alongside her husband
                      Pierre. Sixty years later, in 1995, in honour of their achievements, the
                      remains of both were transferred to the Paris Panthéon. Their remains were
                      sealed in a lead lining because of the radioactivity. She became the
                      second woman to be interred at the Panthéon (after Sophie Berthelot) and the
                      first woman to be honoured with interment in the Panthéon on her own
                      merits.

                      Because of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the
                      1890s are considered too dangerous to handle. Even her cookbooks are
                      highly radioactive. Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and those
                      who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing. In her last
                      year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously
                      in 1935.</p>

                <p class="card-text">In 1891, Marie Curie went to France to study chemistry and began a
                  difficult life. She had to work to support herself and study. She worked part-time
                  at a foundry, while studying French and preparing for the entrance exam to attend
                  the French Academy.

                  She overcame her difficulties and graduated her first in 1893 with a master's degree
                  in Prussia. She then continued her studies and research at the Sorbonne University
                  and received her doctorate in Spectroscopy in 1903.

                  With her husband Pierre Curie, Marie conducted a number of experiments on
                  radioactivity, efforts that led her to the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.

                  After Pierre Curie died in a car accident, Marie continued to work to build her
                  radiological career. She became France's first university professor, and at the same
                  time continued to run the Institute of Radium (Institut du Radium) which she had
                  founded in 1909.

                  During World War I, Marie Curie used her technique to help the French army. She
                  brought in mobile units to take pictures of the wounded soldiers.

                  Her research and technical developments related to radiation had serious effects on
                  her health, and subsequently contributed to her death from lung cancer.

                  Thus, the life and career of Marie Curie is one of the examples of a person's
                  perseverance and efforts in life.In 1891, Marie Curie began her career by working
                  part-time in a foundry and studying at France's La Sorbonne University. She
                  continued her studies and research, and eventually earned her doctorate in
                  Spectroscopy in 1903.

                  After marrying the physicist Pierre Curie in 1895, Maria Curie used her skills and
                  knowledge to help her husband in his studies of radioactivity, and they conducted
                  the research together. For those studies, Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize in Physics
                  1903.

                  After Pierre Curie's sudden death in 1906, Marie Curie continued to work in the
                  field of radioactivity. She became the director of the Radium Institute and the
                  first professor of the University of Paris-VI. She has also developed many other
                  applications of radiation, such as the use of radiation to treat cancer.

                  In 1911, Marie Curie became the first person to win two Nobel Prizes - one in
                  Physics and one in Chemistry - and became the first scientist to win two Nobel
                  Prizes and the first woman to win.

                  Marie Curie has devoted a part of her life to promoting the applications of
                  radioactivity and publicly combating the widespread misrepresentation in the media
                  about the dangers of radiation.

                  However, Marie Curie's work brought her many health problems. She suffered from skin
                  damage and premature aging. She eventually died in 1934 from various
                  radiation-related illnesses, but that was after she had left a great legacy to the
                  global scientific community. </p>
